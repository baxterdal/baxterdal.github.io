<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The Halifax Food Policy Alliance (HFPA) is in the process of co-leading the development of a Food Action Plan (FAP) for the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). The FAP will guide the future development and implementation of food policies and food systems governance in the HRM.</p>

<p>The HFPA is looking for research guidance on how to structure the process of developing the FAP for the HRM. At a minimum, that process will likely include building stakeholder networks, the creation of new co-ordinating or oversight bodies, and the design of a policy process that involves both municipal government and non-government actors.</p>

<p>Our goal is to do a rapid literature review that aims to draw lessons from research on &ldquo;collaborative governance&rdquo; and related models. Broadly speaking, &ldquo;collaborative governance&rdquo; includes governance arrangements &ldquo;that entail the formal engagement (e.g., through statute or administrative law) by state actors and non-state policy stakeholders in sustained dialogues in shared forums to inform on some part of the policy process&rdquo; (Siddiki et al, 2015 at 536). We might also include in that definition less formalized arrangements&ndash;a key feature being that non-state actors play more than simply a consultative or participatory role in these settings.</p>

<h2 id="potential-research-questions">Potential Research Questions</h2>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t yet defined the research question(s) that we want to answer, but these are some possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What do collaborative governance arrangements look like in the context of local government? What are their structural components and relationships?</p></li>

<li><p>What are the features of or preconditions for successful collaborative governance arrangements at the local level?</p></li>

<li><p>What challenges or problems are associated with collaborative governance arrangements at the local level?</p></li>

<li><p>Do collaborative governance arrangements produce better outcomes than conventional local government regulation and programming? (It&rsquo;s unlikely that we would want to take on this big question, but it might be possible to narrow/refine).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="review-process">Review Process</h2>

<p>Review the literature on collaborative governance to understand these arrangements in the context of local government (but not necessarily specific to food issues). Use an expedited PRISMA model on the Covidence platform.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Import citations (incl. abstracts) from general search on databases for &ldquo;collaborative governance&rdquo; and analogous terms</p></li>

<li><p>Screen abstracts on inclusion/exclusion criteria (level of government, policy domains, research method, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>Full text screening</p></li>

<li><p>Data extraction (depending on research questions and volume of included studies)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="databases-for-sample-construction">Databases for Sample Construction</h2>

<p>We may need to narrow these &ndash; Covidence will screen for duplicates:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scopus</p></li>

<li><p>ProQuest</p></li>

<li><p>Web of Science</p></li>

<li><p>Academic Search Premier</p></li>

<li><p>Hein Online</p></li>

<li><p>Westlaw/Lexis</p></li>

<li><p>JSTOR</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="search-terms">Search Terms</h2>

<p>&ldquo;collaborative governance&rdquo;; &ldquo;polycentric governance&rdquo;; &ldquo;adaptive governance&rdquo;;
&ldquo;network governance&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="parameters-for-review-inclusion-exclusion-criteria">Parameters for review: inclusion/exclusion criteria</h2>

<p>(Depends in part on research questions):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Level of government included: municipal</p></li>

<li><p>Policy domains: food, environment/climate, poverty, water</p></li>

<li><p>Research method: case study, theory/conceptual, comparative</p></li>

<li><p>Study results: defines governance model; evaluates governance outcomes; etc</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<p>May 6-10: initial abstract screening (first 100 abstracts); reassess search strategy or complete screening</p>

<p>May 13-17: secondary sample screening reliability; create full text database and start full text screening</p>

<p>May 20-24: complete full text screening; secondary sample screen; assess options for extraction from final set; start extraction</p>

<p>May 27-31: complete preliminary extraction; reassess workload and outputs</p>
