<h1 id="principles-of-title-registration">Principles of Title Registration</h1>

<p>Curtain</p>

<p>Mirror</p>

<p>Assurance</p>

<div class="notes">

Curtain: Registered owner is by definition owner of title (in absence of fraud on owner's part)

Mirror: Once registered, title holder has priority over all prior unregistered interests. Registry reflects all valid interests. 

Assurance (Net): If owner suffers loss because of error or fraud, compensation available.

</div>

<h2 id="curtain">Curtain</h2>

<div class="notes">

Indefeasible title: once registered, title cannot be defeated.

Fraudster can never gain indefeasible title.

Immediate: if purchaser not involved in fraud, title become indefeasible immediately upon registration (no incentive to  "be careful")

Deferred: anyone who deals directly with fraudster is intermediate owner who holds title bus is liable to divestment. Only subsequent purchaser (deferred owner) gains indefeasible title (some incentive to "be careful")

Court in *Lawrence* decides that theory of "deferred indefeasibility" applies. 

</div>

<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>

<div class="notes">

Applying deferred theory to exercise from last day.

</div>

<h2 id="mirror">Mirror</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.google.ca">link</a></p>

<div class="notes">

As with the curtain principle, ideal of mirror principle is not always realized in practice.

Title registry effectively replaces role of "notice" in common law priority rules with "hard line" rule that you can defeat unregistered interests even if you have notice of them.  

Court have worried about when this leads to unfairness.

<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>

<p>What is the status of Rigby&rsquo;s lease?</p>

<div class="notes">

Hypo: what is the status of Rigby's lease? 

- Rigby's lease not registered

- JoJo does not have actual knowledge of Rigby's lease

- But JoJo suspects that Rigby has a lease and circumstances strongly suggest it

Applying mirror principle: doesn't matter if JoJo suspected or knew about Rigby's lease. 

Once JoJo registered title, Rigby's lease no longer good against title (e.g. wouldn't matter if court applied immediate or deferred indefeasibility)

</div>

<h2 id="fraud">Fraud</h2>

<p>Courts ask: at what point does registration with notice of a prior unregistered interest amount to &ldquo;fraud&rdquo;?</p>

<div class="notes">

What behaviour on JoJo's part would "cross the line"? 

Compare the cases:

Hold Renfrew: no fraud, even though purchaser had knowledge of unregistered lease and misrepresented this knowledge to the seller.

McCullough: fraud, where purchaser had knowledge of unregistered covenant and used this knowledge to defeat the covenant by transfer to a third party.

<h1 id="holt-renfrew-co-v-henry-singer-ltd">Holt Renfrew &amp; Co. v. Henry Singer Ltd.</h1>

<div class="notes">

Dickson (lawyer for seller, Thompson & Dynes)

Pekarsky (lawyer for purchaser, Singer Ltd)

Holt Renfrew (long-term lease holder)

Building in Edmonton for sale by vendor, who has a long-term lease with Holt Renfrew (most recently from 1973 to 1990)
 
Holt Renfrew fails to REGISTER the lease on title at the time when lease was first made
 
1978: Pekarsky approaches Dickson about his client purchasing the building; Dickson tells Pekarsky about lease and Pekarsky follows up by letter:

> "With respect to the matter of the existing tenant of the property, we do not believe that situation would be a deterrent to our client's interest."

Pekarsky subsequently finds out that Holt Renfrew's lease is unregistered and proceeds with negotiations about sale without disclosing this fact or retracting his earlier statement in the letter.

Parties reach a deal and Pekarsky immediately files a caveat in the land titles office (i.e., advanced registration of title). Holt Renfrew finds out and subsequently files its own caveat to give notice of its lease interest. But vendor goes ahead with transfer to Singer.

Did Pekarsky's conduct constitute fraud within the meaning of Alberta's land title legislation (given that he knew about the unregistered lease)? 

</div>

<h2 id="land-titles-act-s-203">Land Titles Act, s. 203</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Except in the case of fraud, no person &hellip; is affected by notice direct, implied or constructive, of any trust or unregistered interest in the land, any role of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding, and the knowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not itself be imputed as fraud.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="notes">

But what constitutes "fraud" within meaning of the Act?

Crystal clear: "knowledge" itself is not enough. Must be "knowledge" + "something more"

</div>

<h2 id="test-for-fraud-1">Test for Fraud 1</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Actual knowledge of unregistered interest</p></li>

<li><p>Misrepresentation and reliance</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="notes">

Judges agree on appropriate test for fraud:

1. Pekarsky had ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE of Holt's unregistered interest and knew that that interest would be defeated by the sale and registration 

2. Pekarsky made a MISREPRESENTATION about his knowledge of Holt's unregistered interest (and intention of his client to seek to defeat the lease) AND Dickson RELIED on (i.e. was misled by) the misrepresentation in agreeing to the deal
 
But judges differ on whether Dickson actually RELIED on Pekarsky's earlier statement

- McDermid (dissent): Dickson did rely -- Thompson & Dynes would not have been willing to sell if they knew purchaser not bound by lease
 
- Moir (majority): no reliance -- Dickson MISTAKENLY relied on CERTIFICATE OF TITLE from land registry (listed the earlier 1950 caveat, but not 1973 lease because never recorded), i.e. Dickson relied on his OWN mistake rather than on Pekarsky's misrepresentation
 
Key point: both judgments imply that if Pekarsky had not made the initial representation but simply stood by with knowledge that sale would defeat HR's lease, this would NOT have amounted to fraud.

</div>

<h1 id="alberta-v-mcculloch">Alberta v McCulloch</h1>

<div class="notes">

Similar basic facts to Holt Renfrew.

Alberta held a prior interest in lands that came to be owned by McCulloch

Prior interest (covenant) set out certain restrictions on using the land and gave Minister option to buy back land if not longer being used for certain purposes

Covenant originally registered on title, but removed due to a MISTAKE (i.e. deleted from the land registry)

McCulloch discovers mistake and before Alberta can correct it by re-recording its interest, McCulloch transfers title to a numbered company that he owns with some of his family members. 

New registration of title would, under mirror principle, gain priority over Alberta's subsequently re-registered covenant.

McCulloch claims that transfer to numbered company was for tax purposes, not to defeat Alberta's interest.

</div>

<h2 id="test-for-fraud-2">Test for Fraud 2</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Actual knowledge of unregistered interest</p></li>

<li><p>Used knowledge for &ldquo;unjust or inequitable purpose&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="notes">

Court finds that McCulloch's actions amounted to fraud. 

Why a different result from Holt Renfrew? In both cases, defendants "used" their knowledge of unregistered interest to defeat that interest.

Compare to Holt Renfrew:

- Arguably, Perkarsy's used his knowledge for an "unjust or inequitable" purpose because he sat by and let the sale defeat the lease

- VS argument that Perkarsy didn't actively "use" his knowledge like McCulloch to defeat the registered interest, i.e. he merely did nothing in the face of the seller's own mistake

This is another way of stating the judges' disagreement in Holt Refrew: did Pekarsky actually use his knowledge to mislead Dickson, or was Dickson's mistake the result of his own oversight? 

</div>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<div class="notes">

Where an interest is "unregisterable", all land titles systems make provision for a "caveat" to be filed against title (e.g. agreement of sale).

This process does not bestow validity on the interest, but it does serve as notice to the world of the existence of the interest.

"Lis pendens" --- a special form of caveat that serves as notice of "pending litigation" 

</div>

<h1 id="registration-of-aboriginal-title">Registration of Aboriginal Title</h1>

<div class="notes">

Issue of new importance in era post-Tshil'qotin.

Can Indigenous land rights be "registered" in same way as other interest? 

Revisits theme of how to reconcile common law and indigenous property concepts.

Benefits:

- Indigenous communities/individuals can gain the certainty and security that title registries provide. Especially needed for economic development.
- Where claims are in process and evolving (e.g. AT), registration of caveat can serve as NOTICE to other parties (e.g. Duty to Consult, prevent destruction of lands and resources, claim like Chippewas of Sarnia)

PROBLEMS:

- Land title registries are rigid by design. May require further "shoehorning" of Indigenous land rights into settler land systems such that they will lose their distinctive character (AT, Nisga'a title)

- Inability to accommodate distinctive features of AT (e.g. inalienability) --- basic "incommensurability" here with registries focused on land transactions

Some First Nations–e.g. Nisga'a---have created their OWN land title registries that operate in parallel with those under provincial jurisdiction.
